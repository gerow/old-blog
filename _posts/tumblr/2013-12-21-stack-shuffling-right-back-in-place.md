So, I’m working on building a Magic deck and since all my identical cards were together I decided to stack shuffle twice to distribute things nicely.
I have a sixty card deck. I started by putting down six stacks and putting them back together with the last stack on the top and the first stack on the bottom. I then put down ten stacks and put them back together with the last stack on the top and the first stack on the bottom.
When I looked through my deck, though, everything seemed to be in the exact same order I began with. I’m going to think about this in my head a bit, but it’s a little late tonight. I’m mostly writing this to make sure I don’t forget it because it’s quite odd.
