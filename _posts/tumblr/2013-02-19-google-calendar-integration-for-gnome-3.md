Today I worked on this: https://github.com/gerow/gnome-shell-google-calendar.  It is a fork of this popular python script that makes it to where google calendar events show up in GNOME 3’s time element.  It ends up looking something like this:

The main difference between the original repo and my version is that mine has scripts to generate .deb files to make for an easy installation, at least under Ubuntu. Of course there are a few additional changes that needed to be made to facilitate this. If you’re using Ubuntu under GNOME 3 you should try it out.
